we can apply BÃ©zout's identity to find if measuring a certain amount of water 
using jugs with given capacities is possible. 

Specifically, if the most common divisor of the jug capacities divides the 
desired amount of water, then it is possible to measure that amount using the jugs.

if (target % gcd(jug1_cap, jug2_cap) == 0):
    then possible
