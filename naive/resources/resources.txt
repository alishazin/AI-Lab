Gaussian NB:

Here instead of using the normal pdf (prob distribution func), we 
will use the log based pdf because of the underflow error.

While applying log, we have to change * to + in the entire formula (u know, but dont forget)

So the equation goes from 'formula-with-pdf.jpeg' to 'formula-with-log.jpeg'

Also, if for any feature, the variance happens to be zero, we will replace it with 
a small positive value so that log(variance) doesnt end up being undefined (error).
This is done by the 'var_smoothing' parameter
